# Grade 11 Club Selection Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete club selection system for Grade 11 students that allows them to select multiple clubs only once during their first login, with permanent storage and automatic dashboard redirect on subsequent logins.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

### üéØ **All Requirements Successfully Implemented**

**‚úÖ First Login Flow**
- **First login detection**: System checks if Grade 11 student has any club assignments
- **Club selection trigger**: Shows selection page only when no clubs are assigned
- **Dashboard redirect**: After selection, redirects to main Grade 11 dashboard
- **Subsequent logins**: Skip selection page and go directly to dashboard

**‚úÖ Club Selection Page (UI)**
- **Title**: "Select Your Clubs" prominently displayed
- **6 Available Clubs**: Science, Humanities, Social Science, Math, Art, Mind Matters
- **Multiple selection**: Checkboxes allow selecting one or more clubs
- **Save & Continue button**: Confirms and saves selection
- **Validation**: Prevents saving without selecting at least one club
- **Back to Login button**: Allows returning to login if needed

**‚úÖ Database Storage**
- **New table**: `grade11_student_clubs` with many-to-many mapping
- **Fields**: id, student_id, club_id, assigned_at
- **Constraints**: UNIQUE(student_id, club_id) prevents duplicates
- **Permanent storage**: Once saved, selections cannot be changed
- **Foreign keys**: Proper relationships to users and clubs tables

**‚úÖ Dashboard Behavior**
- **Authentication flow**: LoginFrame checks for club selection needs
- **One-time selection**: After completion, always goes to dashboard
- **No re-selection**: Club selection page never shows again
- **Grade 9 compatibility**: Existing Grade 9 flow unchanged
